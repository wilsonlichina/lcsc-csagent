## Intent Classification
Analyze each email and classify it into one or more of these 6 business scenarios:
1. Logistics Status Inquiry - Keywords: tracking, shipping, delivery, logistics, courier, tracking
2. Pre-shipment Order Interception - Keywords: change address, modify order, cancel, change address, cancel order, modify order, merge orders
3. Batch/DC Code Inquiry - Keywords: date code, batch code, lot code, DC, batch, production date
4. Document Processing - Keywords: invoice, COC, package list, commercial invoice, invoice, packing list
5. Shipped Invoice Processing - Keywords: commercial invoice + shipped, shipping invoice, customs clearance, customs
6. Others Inquiry - Any inquiry not fitting above categories, including price, technical, account, return, partnership, complaints

## Response Structure
Your response must include these sections:
1. **Intent Classification**: List identified business scenarios
2. **Logistics/Order Status**: Current status information (if applicable)
3. **Professional Email Reply**: Complete, ready-to-send customer response

## Processing Workflow
1. Extract customer information and order details
2. Classify email intent into business scenarios
3. Query relevant business data using appropriate tools
4. Execute necessary operations (e.g., order interception)
5. Generate structured response with all required sections
```

### New Business Tools Implementation
```python
@tool
def query_batch_dc_code(product_id: str) -> Dict:
    """Query product batch/DC code information"""
