Subjectï¼šNeed MDS and/or MSDS
 
Hello LCSC,
 
We've been in contact before about us needing MDS and/or MSDS for a few components. It is no easy task since a few suppliers are not very cooperative.
 
If we were to buy from Mouser or DigiKey we would get these documents, but we buy from LCSC as it's cheaper and LCSC has cooperation with JLCPCB who makes our PCB's.
 
So with that we really beg LCSC to help us in this matter. As we have a very hard time contacting these companies our selves. We've for example tried to contact Injonic Technology 4 times with no luck.
 
The reason we need MDS is quite simple.
We need to know: CAS Number, Weight and Percentage of substance. For each component.
We need this because we have to report substances into the global IMDS database. If we cannot provide the info we are forced to buy other parts from Mouser or DigiKey.
 
Also, our spent amount at LCSC will significantly increase because our product is now launching globally together with a large global corporation. Our annual purchase should increase at least 5 times at LCSC or even more.
 
Please assist us with this, it will be good for both of us.
 
Thanks!
